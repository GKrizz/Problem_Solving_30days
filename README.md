## Program 1: Income Calculation
This program reads three integers representing the price per unit (`P`), the number of units (`H`), and a reference value (`R`). It calculates the total income by multiplying `P` and `H`, then checks if this total income is equal to, greater than, or less than `R`. Based on this comparison, it prints **"BARELY"**, **"YES"**, or **"NO"**.
You can view the code [👆🏻here](program.c#L1-L26). 

## Program 2: Super-Long Integer Divisibility by 4
This program reads a super-long integer `N` and checks if it is divisible by 4. It prints **"Ok"** if `N` is not divisible by 4, and **"AAAAAAAAAA!!!"** if it is divisible by 4.
You can view the code [👆🏻here](program.c#L14-L34).

 ## Problem 3 :Sum of Even Numbers in an Array
 Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the array.
 You can view the code [👆🏻here](program.c#L36-L52).

## Program 4: n-th Term of Arithmetic Progression
Problem: Find the n-th term of an arithmetic progression where A is the first term and D is the common difference.
 You can view the code [👆🏻here](program.c#L54-L63).
 
## Program 5 : Can Ben Afford His Rent?
Problem: Determine if Ben can afford his rent with his job, which pays P per hour, and he works H hours per month. The rent costs R.

## Program 1: Income Calculation

This program reads three integers representing the price per unit (`P`), the number of units (`H`), and a reference value (`R`). It calculates the total income by multiplying `P` and `H`, then checks if this total income is equal to, greater than, or less than `R`. Based on this comparison, it prints **"BARELY"**, **"YES"**, or **"NO"**.

You can view the code [here](program.c#L1-L26). 

## Program 2: Super-Long Integer Divisibility by 4

This program reads a super-long integer `N` and checks if it is divisible by 4. It prints **"Ok"** if `N` is not divisible by 4, and **"AAAAAAAAAA!!!"** if it is divisible by 4.

You can view the code [here](program.c#L28-L55).

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these programs, use the following commands:
